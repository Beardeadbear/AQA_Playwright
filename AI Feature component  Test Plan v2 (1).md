# 4\. Test Plan

### 1\. Scope of Testing

**In-Scope**: Testing will cover the AI Feature component, including:

1. Dragging and dropping the component onto a screen.  
2. Selecting and managing data sources.  
3. **Entering prompts using the enhanced prompt feature with generic headings (Core Goal, Context, Functional Requirements, UI & UX Guidelines, Accessibility).**  
4. Generating code based on prompts.  
5. Previewing generated features (forms, directory listings, etc.).  
6. Validating generated code and UI elements.  
7. **Testing generated features that query AI (e.g., dynamic content generation on button click).** *(This covers "AI to query AI")*  
8. **Verification of user-facing error messages (toast messages) for various scenarios (e.g., data source security rule violations, form validation failures, AI query errors).** *(This covers "toast messages instead of just the console")*  
9. **Validation of comprehensive form validation logic (e.g., email format, password strength/mismatch, required fields, date of birth validation, phone number validation).**  
10. **Assessment of UI/UX guideline adherence in generated features (e.g., visual hierarchy, responsive layout, micro-interactions, success states, error states).**  
11. Functional testing of all generated feature types (e.g., form submissions, directory filtering/searching, tax calculations, poem generation).

**Out-of-Scope**: This test plan does not cover:

1. Performance testing of the AI code generation process itself.  
2. Security testing beyond basic input validation and verification of configured data source security rules.  
3. Compatibility testing with older Fliplet Studio versions.  
4. Deep learning model accuracy or AI response quality (focus is on integration and display).  
   

### 2\. Testing Objectives

1. Validate that the AI Feature component correctly generates code based on user prompts, **adhering to the new prompt structure and UI/UX guidelines.**  
2. Ensure that generated features function as expected (e.g., form submissions, directory filtering, **AI-driven content generation**).  
3. Verify that the component integrates correctly with data sources **for both reading and writing operations (where applicable), considering security rules.**  
4. **Confirm that all errors are reported effectively to the user via toast messages, improving user feedback.**  
5. **Verify that generated forms implement robust client-side validation and provide clear inline error messages and success states.**  
6. Ensure compliance with ISO 27001 and GDPR, particularly in handling user data (if any) and accessibility standards.
